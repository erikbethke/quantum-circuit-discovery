Would you like me to **mock up the actual flow diagrams \+ pseudocode** for each (so you could drop them straight into a provisional filing), or keep this high-level skeleton style for now?

Locked in. I pushed IonQ REST embodiments, cURL \+ TS stubs, two GHZ worked-example payloads, and a REST swimlane into the canvas (same doc).

Quick pointers:

* Generator can now **batch** offspring to `/v0.3/jobs`; evaluator uses **v0.4** to poll \+ fetch probabilities.

* Native-gate genomes are concrete (GPI/GPI2 \+ MS), so the **IonQ embodiment** reads like a real system, not vibes.

Next bites (I‚Äôll queue these up when you say go):

* export the Mermaid diagrams to **SVGs** and tuck them under each filing,

* run the **GHZ simulator/noisy** jobs and paste the probability vectors \+ `gate_counts` as figures,

* assemble a 3‚Äì4q **QFT** rediscovery and add the before/after native transpile.

Want me to add a tiny **.env \+ npm script** block to the doc so your team can hit the IonQ API from Node in 30 seconds flat?

# **IonQ REST Embodiments (v0.2)**

## **Filing 1 ‚Äî Generator (REST Embodiment)**

* **Submit multi-circuit batch:** `POST https://api.ionq.co/v0.3/jobs` with `input: [ {...}, {...} ]` for offspring evaluation.

* **Native gates constraint:** set `gateset: "native"` and restrict genome ops to GPI, GPI2, MS (Aria) or ZZ (Forte).

* **Backend targets:** `simulator` (ideal), `aria-1` (hardware), `noisy_simulator` (if exposed). Include noise and error\_mitigation fields.

**cURL Example:**

```shell
curl -X POST "https://api.ionq.co/v0.3/jobs" \
  -H "Authorization: apiKey $IONQ_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "gen-12-evals",
    "target": "simulator",
    "shots": 512,
    "input": [
      {"format":"ionq.circuit.v0","qubits":3,"circuit":[{"gate":"h","target":0} ]},
      {"format":"ionq.circuit.v0","qubits":3,"circuit":[{"gate":"x","target":1} ]}
    ],
    "noise": { "model": "harmony" },
    "error_mitigation": { "debias": false }
  }'
```

## **Filing 2 ‚Äî Evaluation (REST Adapter)**

* Replace local simulator with IonQ REST adapter (v0.4).

* Flow: `POST /jobs` ‚Üí poll `GET /v0.4/jobs/{id}` ‚Üí fetch `GET /v0.4/jobs/{id}/results/probabilities`.

* Use `stats.gate_counts`, `stats.qubits` for depth/2Q metrics.

**Adapter (TS/Node):**

```ts
async function ionqSubmit(job: any, apiKey: string): Promise<string> {
  const r = await fetch("https://api.ionq.co/v0.4/jobs", { method:"POST", headers:{"Authorization":`apiKey ${apiKey}`,"Content-Type":"application/json"}, body: JSON.stringify(job)});
  const j = await r.json(); return j.id;
}

async function ionqWaitAndResults(id: string, apiKey: string) {
  while (true) {
    const jr = await fetch(`https://api.ionq.co/v0.4/jobs/${id}`, { headers:{"Authorization":`apiKey ${apiKey}`} });
    const j = await jr.json();
    if (j.status==="completed") {
      const pr = await fetch(`https://api.ionq.co/v0.4/jobs/${id}/results/probabilities`, { headers:{"Authorization":`apiKey ${apiKey}`} });
      return { job:j, probs: await pr.json() };
    }
    if (["failed","canceled"].includes(j.status)) throw new Error(`Job ${j.status}`);
    await new Promise(r => setTimeout(r, 1500));
  }
}
```

# **Running TODO (live)**

* **Worked examples**: implement GHZ‚Äëlike finder (3‚Äì4 qubits, shallow depth) and QFT‚Äësignature rediscovery; produce JSON reports \+ diagrams for inclusion.

* **Pick first demo**: **Recommend GHZ‚Äëlike first** (clean entanglement metrics, short depth, IonQ‚Äëfriendly), then QFT rediscovery.

* **Lock claims timing**: **File now** with broad independents \+ rich dependent sets; run a week of sims; adjust dependent claims and add continuation material in the non‚Äëprovisional. Optionally file a supplemental provisional update later within 12 months with improved embodiments.

* **IonQ embodiment polish**: parameter‚Äësnapping, error budgets, and spot‚Äëhardware validation language.

* **Figures**: export Mermaid to SVG and include in each filing.

      return { job: j, probs: await pr.json() };
    }
    if (j.status === "failed" || j.status === "canceled") throw new Error(`Job ${j.status}`);
    await new Promise(r => setTimeout(r, 1500));
  }
}
```

      { "gate": "cnot", "control": 0, "target": 2 }
    ]
  }
}
```

```json
{
  "name": "ghz-3q-native",
  "target": "simulator",
  "shots": 2000,
  "input": {
    "gateset": "native",
    "qubits": 3,

      { "gate": "ms",   "phases": [0,0], "targets": [0,2] }
    ]
  }
}
```

## **C) Application Mapping ‚Äî Hardware‚ÄëFit Signals**

* Read from `job.stats.gate_counts`, `job.results.depth`, backend name, and noise model.

* Define **hardware\_fit \= f(native\_compliance, 2Q\_budget, depth, fidelity\_est)**.

* Prefer native‚Äëcompliant circuits for IonQ‚Äëaligned mappings.
