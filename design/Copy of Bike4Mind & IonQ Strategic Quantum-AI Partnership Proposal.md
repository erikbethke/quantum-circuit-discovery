## **Bike4Mind & IonQ Strategic Quantum-AI Partnership Proposal**

**Pre-Amble:**  
AI, genAI, Agents, agentic, AGI, ASI consciousness, sentience \- all of these words \- and my favorite "Strong AI" . What do they even mean? Strong AI is the humble version of "yes" applied to all of these.

During the introductory call that I had with Peter Chapman, we shared our high-level visions for Strong AI and we had surprisingly strong alignment with each other:

We both agreed that Strong AI is NOT simply the largest pre-trained LLM solution that money and data can buy. We are both aligned in a horizontal system that employs bold ***search*** strategies.

Peter specifically noted as a designer of more than one computer language compiler and interpreter that the grammar of a given language contains the information to enumerate all possible programs that the language is able to generate. From that notion, he suggests that to solve Strong AI one should enumerate and generate all possible programs and then transform the problem to a **search** problem... (\!)

Peter Chapman shared with me that he was excited to join IONQ and rally around Quantum computing explicitly to discover how to achieve quantum supremacy over classical techniques to be able to master this vast search space that Strong AI needs to cover.

At the same time, I have been pursuing the framework "*Everything is Search*": In short everything that can possibly exist in the past, present, future, digital, virtual, imagined and dreamed exists simultaneously in the hyper dimensional universe (HDU). Then to get the best answer, "all" one needs to do is "select the best tool" to search the HDU: 

In Everything is Search, there are three "buckets"

* Bucket 1 \- Classical algorithms \- arithmetic, algebra, calculus, look-up tables, dictionaries, sorting algorithms, classical DBs, numerical methods, random choice  
* Bucket 2 \- Data science \- LLMs, diffusion, human emotion, intuition, genetic algorithms, etc  
* Bucket 3 \- Quantum Algorithms \- Shor, Grover, Deutsch-Joza

Currently when people complain that LLMs cannot count the number of Rs in Strawberry, we hold that this powerfully and ironically demonstrates that one should NOT use a bucket 2 tool \- an LLM to count Rs in strawberry but instead use a bucket 1 tool \- say a simple python program to count your letters.

Notice that these buckets have a distinct ordering. If your problem can be solved \[efficiently\] via a bucket 1 tool, then use that \- it will be the least compute, energy and data thirsty solution. If you cannot solve via bucket 1, then look into bucket 2 \- the era of big data and modern AI solutions have already delivered so much transformative value. And of course if you lack a classical algorithm and you do not have enough data to power a bucket 2 tool, then your solution lies in the realm of quantum \- bucket 3\. Recognizing what sort of problem you have and estimating which tool is likely to be most efficient is a challenge, but clearly the solution to Strong AI is flattening all problems into one big fat search problem.

**Assembling Notions:**

* Peter and Erik both want to solve Strong AI and see a kaleidoscope of opportunities  
* NdM is focused on growing the IONQ business \- the ecosystem, proving use-cases, growing patents, but at the end of the day show that Quantum computing has arrived manifested in good-old fashioned revenue  
* NdM further suggested Quantum AI Energy Distribution as a line to pursue.  
* Erik began to noodle around with the Quantum "Hello World" same programs on the IONQ website, and then just started to dig in on quantum computing in general.  
* Quantum is alien and weird, all of your priors from classical computing are actually a distraction and unhelpful on how to build quantum solutions

**Idea 1:**  
The first idea was, wow, the state of the art quantum computing is objectively intimidating, obtuse and hard to get to quickly aha \- this is fun \- I want to make moar\! So, build up more examples, create more videos, make more higher-level constructs and try to leverage a career in consumer game development experience and turn this from unfun to fun. A *Quantum Cookbook* if you will. Nothing wrong with this idea, but what else?

**Idea 2:**  
Again focused on making Quantum computing actually fun \- look for art-projects, leveraging entanglement and other quantum bits. Perhaps mix-in Conway's game of Life with Flatland: A Romance of Many Dimensions and create a *Quantum Realm* with Quantum creatures that live and evolve in moments of quantum progress. Could be fun, could be cool, the challenge will be to really make something that is distinctly only possible through quantum supremacy otherwise the same can be achieved classically.

**Idea 3:**  
Explore combining classical and quantum techniques in hybrid systems. This holds a lot of promise, indeed likely to be where real-world applied solutions will effectively play. Quantum networking, networked communication protocols that exploit entanglement paired with classical cryptographic techniques seem to have near-term applications. Likely the Quantum AI Energy Distribution solutions will be practical hybrids.

**Idea 4:**  
Implement a form of Mechanistic Interpretability to carve a chunk of a large LLMs weights into a black box and use quantum supremacy to better elucidate what that chunk of the black box actually does. After some preliminary research, this seems to be *impractical* on the current sized systems. *Scratched*.

Digging into the code, the literature, and coming to understand that my priors are slowing me down \- the Oracle construction problem "oracle handwaving". I started to wonder if perhaps we are going about all of this the wrong way. Maybe the actual feeling that it is hard to think through deterministic quantum algorithm design is valuable feedback itself\!

Nature clearly is excellent at quantum techniques \- all over the place \- Photosynthesis (Exciton Transport),  
Magnetoreception in Birds (Radical Pair Mechanism), Enzyme Catalysis (Quantum Tunneling), Olfaction (Vibration Theory), Vision (Photon Detection). Talk about applied quantum computing\!\! How does nature "code" quantum solutions that are so effective? By analogy, no one hand-crafts a 70B state of the art LLM by hand, or by cranking out matrix multiplications in a spreadsheet. Why should we *assume* that the most efficient method to designing a solution to efficient energy distribution via quantum AI would be explicitly designed by a human? 

The winning idea: **Discover First, Apply Later**

**Discover First, Apply Later:**

Peter Chapman's program enumeration idea comes to life\! In Appendix B we have laid out the 20-odd "Lego" building blocks and their corresponding Qbit "cost". Take the state of the art systems from IONQ and these Legos as the grammar, and having a budget of just 29 or 36 Qbits to work with, there are an estimated 5-10 million possible quantum circuits that could be built with the IONQ machines today. 

We propose to leverage evolutionary algorithms and genetic programming (building on prior work, yet not deeply mined \- see Literature Review)  to efficiently "grow" and evolve quantum circuits in this 5-10m space and then identify valuable, novel circuits. Then, as a secondary and a derivative effort, identify useful applications. Discover First, Apply Later \- just like nature.

# Appendix A \- Literature Review

## **Discover First, Apply Later**

# **Introduction**

Designing **quantum circuits** (sequences of quantum gates on qubits) is notoriously challenging. Classical computers cannot easily simulate large quantum systems, and relatively few quantum algorithms are known () (). This has motivated researchers to apply **evolutionary algorithms (EAs)**, **genetic programming (GP)**, and other AI techniques to automatically discover quantum circuits. Unlike conventional approaches that start with a specific problem and hand-craft a circuit, some researchers explore *open-ended* discovery – generating circuits without a predetermined application and evaluating them by criteria like novelty or entanglement. The hope is that such *machine-discovered* circuits might exhibit interesting quantum behaviors or even implement useful algorithms that humans haven’t conceived, allowing a kind of “**reverse application discovery**” (find the circuit first, figure out what it can do later). In this review, we survey the landscape of research on these approaches, focusing on:

* Methods that **evolve quantum circuits** in a problem-agnostic way (open-ended search).  
* **Fitness criteria** emphasizing novelty, complexity, or quantum-specific metrics (e.g. entanglement) rather than direct utility.  
* Efforts to **match or repurpose discovered circuits** to real applications after the fact.

We identify key contributors and groups in this area, highlight important publications and venues, note any practical implementations, and discuss gaps or opportunities for novel research. Technical details of how these algorithms represent and evaluate quantum circuits are also covered, providing insight into how machine intelligence can *create quantum logic*. Finally, we critically assess how new or established this “circuits-first, application-later” approach truly is.

## **Early Pioneers in Evolving Quantum Circuits**

The idea of using evolutionary search to design quantum circuits dates back over two decades. Some notable early contributions include:

* **Colin Williams & Alexander Gray (1998)** – Among the first to propose **automated quantum circuit design**, exploring genetic search to find circuits close to a given unitary matrix (). Their work in a 1998 NASA conference introduced the notion that a GA could evolve a circuit to approximate a target operation (), foreshadowing later “quantum synthesis” algorithms.  
* **Lee Spector and colleagues (1998–2004)** – A leading figure in quantum GP. Spector’s team demonstrated that GP can invent new quantum circuits that solve problems better than classical methods () (). For example, they evolved a circuit for the “two-oracle AND/OR” problem that achieved a success probability beyond what any classical algorithm could attain (). This result, discovered via evolutionary search, was a *new quantum algorithm* unknown to humans until then. Spector’s group also re-discovered known quantum algorithms (like variants of Deutsch-Jozsa) and tackled tasks like entanglement generation and error-correcting codes. They reported multiple “human-competitive” results, even earning a prize in 2004 for circuits evolved by GP that matched or exceeded human-derived solutions (). Key publications from this group include a 1999 paper on GP for quantum computing and a 2008 journal article titled *“Machine Invention of Quantum Computing Circuits by Means of GP.”* () () These works firmly established that evolutionary methods can **automatically discover quantum circuits** that are non-obvious and theoretically significant.  
* **H. Barnum, H. Bernstein, & L. Spector (2000)** – In *Journal of Physics A*, they published quantum circuits for OR and AND-of-OR functions found via GP ([Publications | Lee Spector](https://lspector.github.io/publications.html#:~:text=Barnum%2C%20H,8057.%20%28postscript%2C%20pdf)). These circuits solved oracle problems with fewer queries or higher success than classical limits, illustrating how open-ended search can yield novel quantum logic.  
* **Benjamin Rubinstein (2001)** – Applied genetic programming specifically to evolve circuits that **produce maximally entangled states** (). Rather than targeting a useful computation, this work used **entanglement** as the goal: starting from unentangled inputs and evolving a sequence of gates that outputs an entangled state (e.g. a Bell pair or GHZ state). The fitness function rewarded high entanglement (using a measure of quantum correlation) and penalized failure. This was an early example of valuing *“interesting” quantum behavior (entanglement) over any immediate application*. Rubinstein’s GP system indeed found gate combinations to generate entangled qubits (), validating that evolutionary search can discover fundamentally quantum features.  
* **Martin Lukac & Marek Perkowski (2002)** – Explored a GA approach for evolving quantum circuits to match a **target unitary matrix** (). Their work (NASA/DoD Evolvable Hardware Conference, 2002\) encoded quantum gates as “genes” and evolved populations of circuits, aiming to reproduce a given transformation (for instance, a known 2-qubit gate) with minimal error. While this is problem-driven (target known unitary), it contributed important techniques for representing and mutating quantum circuits in an evolutionary algorithm.  
* **Jonathon (J.J.) Massey et al. (2004)** – Built on Spector’s framework to evolve other quantum algorithms, possibly introducing multi-objective criteria. (For example, the GP might optimize for both success probability and circuit size.) Although details are sparse here, by mid-2000s the foundation for evolutionary quantum circuit design was well established through these efforts.

**Key insights from this early era:** Genetic programming can treat quantum gate sequences as programs that are evolved via selection and mutation. Even with only a few qubits (2–4 qubits, due to simulator limits ()), GP found creative solutions: circuits that humans “were unlikely to have thought of” ([Physics \- Computer Chooses Quantum Experiments](https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/Physics.9.25#:~:text=computing%20and%20quantum%20cryptography,that%20are%20hard%20to%20understand)). Notably, these were often driven by non-standard objectives – e.g. maximize entanglement or solve a contrived oracle task – underscoring the potential for *open-ended discovery*. Spector’s work also introduced useful techniques like linear “gate array” genomes vs. tree-based GP (finding linear genomes more efficient for quantum programs () ()) and lexicographic multi-objective fitness (prioritizing correctness, then simplicity) (). These innovations carried into later research.

## **Modern Approaches and Techniques**

Building on these pioneering studies, a variety of modern approaches have been developed to algorithmically **generate quantum circuits**. Many incorporate machine learning or refined evolutionary strategies. Below we outline several key categories, highlighting how they evaluate circuits (especially on novelty or complexity) and any notable use of open-ended criteria:

### **Genetic Programming & Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs)**

GP/EAs remain a core method for quantum circuit discovery:

* **Developmental Genetic Programming:** Spector’s team used *developmental GP*, where individuals in the population are programs that *construct* quantum circuits when executed (). This allowed dynamic circuit sizing and conditional gate placement. Fitness was often domain-specific (e.g. percentage of oracle queries answered correctly, or probability of desired measurement outcomes) combined with parsimony pressure for shorter circuits. For example, in evolving the AND/OR algorithm, the GP fitness rewarded a circuit’s success probability at distinguishing two oracle outputs, and only if equal would it compare circuit lengths (). This approach yielded circuits solving Deutsch’s problem, the OR problem, etc., some of which were retrospectively identified as novel quantum algorithms ().  
* **Entanglement-Oriented GA:** Some researchers explicitly use **quantum entanglement measures** as the fitness. Rubinstein’s GP (2001) is one example, where the fitness measured how close the output state was to a maximally entangled state (). More recent work by others has similarly targeted entanglement or other “quantum-ness” metrics. For instance, one could maximize the Meyer-Wallach entanglement measure or entangling power of a circuit. Such an EA effectively *searches the space of circuits for ones that exhibit strong quantum correlations*, without asking that circuit to perform a useful function. The assumption is that highly entangled states are a resource – once found, they might be leveraged for quantum communication or computing tasks.  
* **Quantum Circuit Architecture Search (QAS) with GAs:** In the NISQ era, a lot of attention has shifted to **variational quantum circuits (VQCs)**. Here the goal is to find a good *ansatz* (circuit template with tunable parameters) for a given task (like classifying data or finding a molecule’s ground state). Several works apply genetic algorithms to **search over circuit structures**. For example, **Zhang & Zhao (2022)** propose an evolutionary algorithm for QAS, evolving parameterized circuit designs for classification problems (). Similarly, **Ding & Spector (2022)** introduce an evolutionary strategy to build circuits in a reinforcement learning context (), and **Rattew et al. (2019)** developed an “evolutionary variational quantum eigensolver” for chemistry, using mutation/crossover to improve an ansatz for energy minimization (). These approaches often use multi-objective fitness: e.g. **maximize fidelity or accuracy** on the task **while minimizing circuit depth** (to avoid noise). One recent GA framework called **GA4QCO (Genetic Algorithm for Quantum Circuit Optimization)** explicitly allows the user to define custom fitness – for instance, “prepare this target state with fidelity \> X *and* use as few gates as possible” (). The GA then evolves circuits meeting those criteria. While these are problem-driven (user-defined goals), they demonstrate the flexibility of EAs to handle *any* circuit property as part of fitness. A user could just as well plug in a “novelty” or “entanglement” score as the objective.  
* **Multi-Objective and Novelty Metrics:** Genetic algorithms can be adapted to encourage **diversity and novelty** in discovered circuits. A recent trend in evolutionary computing is **Novelty Search**, which abandons a single fixed goal and instead rewards individuals for being different from prior solutions ([How are Novelty Search algorithms used in Genetics?](https://blog.logicapt.com/novelty-search-algorithms-in-genetics/#:~:text=Let%27s%20dive%20into%20what%20exactly,uncover%20diverse%20and%20innovative%20solutions)) ([How are Novelty Search algorithms used in Genetics?](https://blog.logicapt.com/novelty-search-algorithms-in-genetics/#:~:text=realization%20that%2C%20while%20efficient%2C%20conventional,is%20vast%20and%20poorly%20understood)). In principle, one could apply novelty search to quantum circuits – for example, reward circuits that produce unique output state distributions or uncommon gate sequences. There is also **Quality Diversity (QD)**, which tries to find a *set* of high-performing solutions that are diverse. While not widely applied yet in quantum contexts, there is emerging work. For instance, researchers in 2024 introduced **YAQQ (Yet Another Quantum Quantizer)**, a tool that uses novelty search to explore different quantum **gate sets** for compiling algorithms ([\[2406.17610\] YAQQ: Yet Another Quantum Quantizer \-- Design Space Exploration of Quantum Gate Sets using Novelty Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17610#:~:text=key%20factors%3A%20,Our%20results%20demonstrate)) ([\[2406.17610\] YAQQ: Yet Another Quantum Quantizer \-- Design Space Exploration of Quantum Gate Sets using Novelty Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17610#:~:text=decomposition%2C%20and%20,sets%20in%20representing%20quantum%20algorithms)). Their cost function combines performance (circuit depth, fidelity) with a **novelty term** that favors gate sets yielding different trade-offs ([\[2406.17610\] YAQQ: Yet Another Quantum Quantizer \-- Design Space Exploration of Quantum Gate Sets using Novelty Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17610#:~:text=evaluation%20is%20conditioned%20on%20a,novelty%20search%20algorithm%2C%20circuit%20decomposition)). This illustrates how novelty metrics can guide search toward innovative quantum designs. Similarly, preliminary studies on “Quality Diversity for VQC optimization” (Zorn *et al.*, 2025\) suggest that evolutionary algorithms can generate a portfolio of varied ansatz circuits, rather than converging to one structure. These methods are just beginning to bridge into quantum circuit design, representing a promising *open-ended exploration* approach: they aim to uncover a whole landscape of interesting circuits, some of which might later prove useful.

**Technical implementation details:** In GP/GA approaches, quantum circuits are typically encoded as chromosomes or trees of **quantum gate instructions**. A gene might represent “apply Hadamard on qubit 0” or “apply CNOT between q1 and q2.” Mutation could randomly change a gate or its target qubit, while crossover exchanges sub-sequences of two parent circuits. Ensuring validity (not exceeding available qubits or gate count) is handled by constraints or developmental rules. The **fitness function** is crucial – it can range from a simple numerical score (e.g. fidelity to target state ()) to a composite score evaluating multiple aspects (as Spector did with “hits”, “correctness”, “efficiency” lexicographically ()). Some implementations include **parsimony pressure** or a penalty for longer circuits to keep solutions minimal. Others explicitly evolve the circuit *and* its parameters (for parametric gates). For example, a 2022 study by Huang *et al.* evolved both the structure and continuous parameters of a VQA circuit to maximize robustness against noise ([\[2202.13714\] Robust resource-efficient quantum variational ansatz through evolutionary algorithm](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.13714#:~:text=In%20this%20work%2C%20we%20propose,the%20hydrogen%20and%20the%20water)) ([\[2202.13714\] Robust resource-efficient quantum variational ansatz through evolutionary algorithm](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.13714#:~:text=ansatz%20and%20gate%20parameters%2C%20without,tunable)). They used a “genome-length-adjustable” EA that could add/remove gates during evolution, optimizing for shallow depth and low error. This indicates how modern EAs handle both discrete and continuous aspects of quantum circuits.

Overall, genetic programming remains one of the most **versatile tools** for quantum circuit discovery. It has proven capable of finding circuits for specific algorithmic tasks *and* for more open-ended goals like entanglement or novelty. Many key researchers in this vein (aside from Spector) include **Marek Perkowski**’s group (evolving reversible and quantum logic), various contributors to the GECCO and CEC conferences, and more recently groups in China and Europe applying GAs to VQC ansatz search (e.g. Yuxuan Du’s QAS work (), and projects at Fraunhofer/FU Berlin ()).

### **Reinforcement Learning and AI Planning**

Another branch of AI for quantum circuits uses **reinforcement learning (RL)** or heuristic search (like simulated annealing, Bayesian optimization) instead of population-based evolution. These approaches still *generate circuits automatically*, but they learn by iterative trial-and-error improvements or probabilistic sampling:

* **Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL):** En-Jui Kuo, Yao-Lung Fang, and Samuel Chen (2021) demonstrated a **quantum architecture search via DRL** (). In their approach, an RL agent treats the building of a circuit as a sequential decision process: at each step, pick a gate to append. The agent is trained with rewards based on the circuit’s performance on a given task (for example, how well it classifies data or approximates a target unitary). Over many episodes, the DRL agent “learns” strategies to construct better circuits. This method was shown to find circuits with fewer CNOT gates (a common cost metric) while achieving high accuracy, comparable to or better than human-designed ansätze in some cases. RL has the advantage of **incorporating domain knowledge** via reward shaping or state representations. For instance, the state can include the current output of the circuit or some features of it, guiding the agent to add gates that increase entanglement or connectivity. While most RL studies still optimize toward a task, they could in principle reward “interestingness” too. One could imagine an RL agent rewarded for producing high entanglement or novel measurement statistics, encouraging it to venture into uncharted circuit configurations.  
* **Bayesian Optimization & Random Search:** Pirhooshyaran and Terlaky (2021) explored a comparison of **random search, RL, and Bayesian optimization** for quantum circuit design (). Bayesian optimization treats the process as black-box: it samples different circuit structures, evaluates them (e.g. on a machine learning task), and uses a surrogate model to predict promising new samples. This can efficiently search a large space without brute force. While again typically goal-oriented, a Bayesian approach could incorporate *exploration terms* or focus on multi-objective criteria. For example, one might use an acquisition function that favors circuits with a balance of high entanglement and low gate count, to map out a Pareto front of “interesting” circuits.  
* **Heuristic Algorithms and Others:** There are various other AI planning approaches. Some researchers have tried **heuristic state-space search** (like A\* or iterative deepening) for circuit synthesis, but those usually require a specified end goal unitary. More relevant here are **hybrid algorithms** like **Markov Chain Monte Carlo** or **neuroevolutionary methods**. A 2021 work by Z. Lu and D.-L. Deng proposed a *Markovian quantum neuroevolution* approach (), which effectively combines neural network parameter tuning with evolutionary selection of circuit structures. This blurs the line between pure evolution and gradient-based learning. The neural part could help guide the search in a continuous landscape, potentially scaling to larger circuit depths than pure random mutation might.  
* **Neural Network Generators:** An intriguing direction is using generative deep learning to propose circuit designs. The **KANQAS (Kolmogorov-Arnold Network for QAS)** project (2024) exemplifies this – they use a specialized neural network inspired by Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theory to generate candidate circuit blocks for a given problem. While KANQAS is still geared toward problem-driven optimization (seeking circuits that achieve “quantum advantage” on tasks) ([\[2406.17630\] KANQAS: Kolmogorov-Arnold Network for Quantum ...](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17630#:~:text=Quantum%20architecture%20Search%20,quantum%20circuits%20towards%20quantum%20advantage)), it introduces a framework where a neural network could, in theory, be trained to output *creatively new circuit patterns*. In a completely open-ended scenario, one might train a generative model on a diverse set of known quantum circuits (for various functions) and then have it sample new circuits that aren’t in the training set, followed by some evaluation of their properties. This is largely speculative at present, but it’s a conceivable AI-based technique for unconstrained circuit discovery.

**Common thread:** These AI methods often incorporate a clearer sense of direction (via rewards or priors) than blind evolutionary search. However, they can be adapted to multi-goal settings. For example, a reward could be a weighted sum of a circuit’s performance on *multiple* tasks, implicitly pushing for a more generally effective circuit. Or the reward could include a **novelty bonus** if the circuit’s behavior (say, its output distribution) differs significantly from those of prior circuits. Such ideas parallel novelty search in GA, but within an RL paradigm.

Notably, these approaches are being pursued by both academia and industry labs. For instance, **IBM Research** and national labs have looked into RL for circuit optimization (the Kuo et al. work involved authors from University of Maryland and Oak Ridge National Lab). **Baidu Research** and other companies in China have published on quantum architecture search (Yuxuan Du’s work) using optimization algorithms to improve trainability of circuits (). These indicate a growing interest in automated circuit design beyond purely academic circles.

### **Open-Ended Discovery & Novelty-Focused Searches**

The heart of the question is about *truly open-ended* discovery: generating circuits “without a specific problem in mind” and valuing **novel or complex quantum behavior** rather than immediate utility. How far has research gone in this direction?

* **Novelty Search in Practice (Limited Examples):** The purest form of open-ended search would assign *no fixed task-based reward* – instead, the algorithm would roam the space of circuits and perhaps use a **novelty metric** (how different a new circuit is from what’s been seen) or a **complexity metric** (how rich the entanglement or interference pattern is). In classical evolutionary computing, novelty search has led to surprising solutions (e.g. in robotics, where searching for novel behaviors sometimes indirectly yields useful skills). In quantum, this approach is still *largely speculative*, but some steps exist. For instance, the YAQQ tool we mentioned doesn’t search circuit space directly but does illustrate using novelty as part of a cost ([\[2406.17610\] YAQQ: Yet Another Quantum Quantizer \-- Design Space Exploration of Quantum Gate Sets using Novelty Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17610#:~:text=key%20factors%3A%20,implement%20YAQQ%20within%20the%20Qiskit)). A hypothetical quantum novelty search could define a state-space descriptor for a circuit (like the set of output probabilities it produces on certain inputs, or the entanglement spectrum of its output state) and then evolve circuits to maximize diversity in that descriptor space. To our knowledge, no major paper has yet reported “we evolved a bunch of bizarre quantum circuits and then later figured out what they do.” This remains an open opportunity. However, some researchers have implicitly done a form of this: Spector’s early experiments sometimes evolved circuits under loosely-defined goals, then analyzed them. For example, evolving a circuit to maximize a certain interference pattern might yield something later recognized as (say) a half-adder or a particular oracle algorithm. These instances were typically side notes in broader goal-driven studies. The **academic community has not explicitly branded any work as open-ended quantum circuit discovery** aside from those targeting entanglement (which is a well-defined metric but not an “application”). So we can say this area is *partially explored* at best. The concept of evolving circuits first and finding uses later is **not yet well-established** in literature, though it is a logical extension of the techniques that do exist.  
* **Automated Discovery of Quantum Experiments:** A closely related and very illuminating example comes from **quantum optics** rather than quantum computing per se. In 2016, Anton Zeilinger’s group (University of Vienna) developed a program called **MELVIN** to **search for novel quantum optics setups** ([Physics \- Computer Chooses Quantum Experiments](https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/Physics.9.25#:~:text=The%20notoriously%20counterintuitive%20features%20of,that%20are%20hard%20to%20understand)) ([Physics \- Computer Chooses Quantum Experiments](https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/Physics.9.25#:~:text=The%20algorithm%20designed%20by%20Anton,want%20to%20manipulate%20single%20photons)). MELVIN would randomly arrange optical components (beam splitters, mirrors, etc.) and check the resulting quantum state or interference pattern. The goal could be specified (e.g. “produce entanglement between these photons”), but the search was broad and solutions were often unexpected. In one case, MELVIN discovered a complex configuration of components that generated a high-dimensional Greenberger–Horne–Zeilinger (GHZ) entangled state ([Physics \- Computer Chooses Quantum Experiments](https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/Physics.9.25#:~:text=and%20can%20be%20challenging%20to,GHZ%20state%20they%20were%20seeking)) – an outcome the researchers *were seeking*, but the method to get there was entirely computer-found and quite unintuitive ([Physics \- Computer Chooses Quantum Experiments](https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/Physics.9.25#:~:text=The%20notoriously%20counterintuitive%20features%20of,that%20are%20hard%20to%20understand)) ([Physics \- Computer Chooses Quantum Experiments](https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/Physics.9.25#:~:text=Quantum%20theory%20verifies%20that%20Melvin%E2%80%99s,to%20quantum%20physics%2C%E2%80%9D%20says%20Krenn)). The algorithm also found *cyclic transformations* (a sequence of operations that returns a photon to its initial state) that were not asked for explicitly ([Physics \- Computer Chooses Quantum Experiments](https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/Physics.9.25#:~:text=In%20a%20second%20proof%20of,in%20quantum%20computing%20or%20cryptography)). Those cycles were later noted as potentially useful for quantum cryptography or computing ([Physics \- Computer Chooses Quantum Experiments](https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/Physics.9.25#:~:text=In%20a%20second%20proof%20of,in%20quantum%20computing%20or%20cryptography)). This is a prime example of **open-ended quantum discovery**: the program was searching for interesting phenomena (entanglement, cycles) and yielded setups that humans struggled to understand ([Physics \- Computer Chooses Quantum Experiments](https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/Physics.9.25#:~:text=Quantum%20theory%20verifies%20that%20Melvin%E2%80%99s,to%20quantum%20physics%2C%E2%80%9D%20says%20Krenn)), some of which were then retroactively identified as valuable. While MELVIN operates in an optical experiment context, the parallels to quantum circuits are clear: it’s assembling “quantum components” in random ways, finding *weird but working solutions*, then humans map those solutions to concepts (like “a GHZ state generator”). The key researcher here was **Mario Krenn**, a doctoral student in Zeilinger’s group, who has since continued to work on AI for scientific discovery. Their results were published in *Physical Review Letters* ([Physics \- Computer Chooses Quantum Experiments](https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/Physics.9.25#:~:text=the%20potential%20to%20uncover%20new,simplest%20combinations%20of%20experimental%20elements)), marking a significant real-world demonstration of this approach. We mention this because it shows **proof of concept** that open-ended search can reveal useful quantum processes. A direct translation to circuit model computing would be to let an algorithm shuffle quantum gates freely, perhaps targeting generic “high entanglement” or certain symmetries, and see what circuits pop out – then test if any implement known algorithms or new ones. This kind of **reverse engineering of evolved circuits** is ripe for exploration.  
* **Complexity as a Feature:** Evaluating circuits by **complexity** (apart from novelty or entanglement) could mean rewarding longer or more intricate circuits – but that is usually counterproductive (it’s easy to get a long random circuit that does nothing particularly interesting). More meaningful is to reward *computational richness*, e.g. circuit’s output should not be trivial (not all zeros or product state). Some researchers have considered **algorithmic complexity or entropy** of the output distribution as a fitness measure. A circuit that maps inputs to a highly non-uniform, complex output distribution might be deemed “interesting.” However, concrete instances of this in literature are scarce. Complexity measures have more often been used as something to *minimize* (to keep circuits short). An exception is in **quantum chaos and random circuit studies**: physicists sometimes generate random circuits to see when they approximate unitary 2-designs or produce chaotic entanglement spreading. Those studies don’t use evolution, but they do value the circuits for their complex behavior (like high entanglement entropy akin to thermalization). In principle, an EA could be directed to *maximize a chaos or entropy metric*. No prominent paper yet explicitly does this, but it aligns with the idea of seeking “quantum complexity” for its own sake.

In summary, **open-ended, novelty-driven quantum circuit discovery is an emerging idea that is not fully realized**. Research so far has mostly kept a loose grip on a goal (entangle these qubits, approximate this unitary, solve this oracle) and then been surprised by the creative solutions found. Truly letting an algorithm wander and then *retrofitting meaning* to the result remains a novel approach – one that the community has only dabbled in through the above examples. This suggests a **gap** in research: methodologies explicitly designed for discovery-first, application-later exploration of quantum circuits have not been thoroughly developed. The successes of MELVIN in quantum optics and Spector’s GP in uncovering the OR/AND algorithm hint that there is value in such exploration. A systematic framework for it (maybe combining novelty search, entanglement metrics, and automated circuit analysis) could be a **novel contribution** to the field.

## **Key Researchers, Groups, and Venues**

From the discussion above, we can identify several **key research groups and individuals** that have significantly contributed to automatic quantum circuit generation and open-ended discovery:

* **Lee Spector** (formerly Hampshire College, now at Amherst College, USA) – A pioneer of quantum genetic programming. His work (with Jon Klein, Howard Barnum, Herbert Bernstein, etc.) in the late 90s and 2000s produced new quantum algorithms via GP (). Spector authored *Automatic Quantum Computer Programming* (2004), the first book on the subject, and continues to publish on evolutionary circuit design (e.g. a 2023 paper on multi-objective quantum circuit search). He is also Editor-in-Chief of the journal *Genetic Programming and Evolvable Machines*, which has been a venue for some of this research.  
* **Hideo (Marek) Perkowski’s group** (Portland State University, USA) – Worked on evolving quantum and reversible logic circuits in the early 2000s. Martin Lukac, a student of Perkowski, co-authored the 2002 GA paper (). They often presented at conferences like NASA Evolvable Hardware.  
* **Colin P. Williams** (formerly at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Lab) – An early advocate for quantum circuit synthesis; while known for algorithmic contributions to quantum computing, he co-wrote the 1998 paper on automated design (). His involvement ties NASA into early exploration of this space.  
* **Mario Krenn** (University of Vienna \-\> University of Toronto) – Developed MELVIN and related AI systems for quantum experiment design ([Physics \- Computer Chooses Quantum Experiments](https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/Physics.9.25#:~:text=The%20algorithm%20designed%20by%20Anton,want%20to%20manipulate%20single%20photons)). Krenn, along with Anton Zeilinger (Nobel laureate, 2022), showed how evolutionary/random algorithms can design complex quantum setups. Krenn has also explored using **deep learning to uncover quantum experiment structures**, merging neural networks with discovery (e.g. proposing “latent space” representations for experiments). His work appears in **Physical Review Letters** and was featured in popular science outlets, raising awareness of AI-designed quantum experiments.  
* **Yuxuan Du and Dacheng Tao** (University of Sydney, and later institutions in China) – Du et al. introduced the QAS (quantum architecture search) algorithm (), one of the first systematic methods to design VQE ansatze automatically. While problem-driven, their work (2020–2022) in venues like *NeurIPS* and on arXiv has been influential in showing the power of automated circuit design for machine learning applications.  
* **Dong-Ling Deng** (Tsinghua University, China) – Deng’s group explores the interface of quantum computing and machine learning. They proposed the **Markovian Quantum Neuroevolution** approach () and have discussed the idea of using policy optimization for circuit design. They’re part of a growing quantum ML community in Asia pushing these methods forward.  
* **IBM Quantum team / Oak Ridge National Lab** – Researchers like Yao-Lung Fang and Samuel Yen-Chi Chen (who have ties to ORNL and University of Tennessee) have published on **deep RL for circuit search** (the 2021 arXiv paper cited above). IBM’s open-source Qiskit community has also experimented with automated ansatz generation (e.g. the *Qiskit Aqua* had a feature to incrementally build ansatze). IBM and other industry labs often present such work at the IEEE **Quantum Software and QCE (Quantum Computing and Engineering)** conferences.  
* **Zapata Computing (Arthur Rattew, et al.)** – A quantum software startup whose scientists developed the evolutionary VQE approach (). Their 2019 paper (arXiv:1910.09694) emphasized hardware-efficiency and noise robustness, showing industry interest in evolutionary design to get better results on real hardware.  
* **Fraunhofer FOKUS / LMU Munich (Leo Süßkel, Sebastian Feld, etc.)** – These researchers (Germany) created the GA4QCO framework and have explored Quality-Diversity for quantum circuits (Maximilian Zorn and co-authors, 2024). They often publish in arXiv and at ML-related conferences (one reference shows an ICAPS 2025 abstract on QD for VQCs). This group merges quantum computing with **evolutionary computation expertise**, coming from a computer science perspective.  
* **Conferences and Journals:** Major forums for this interdisciplinary work include: the **Genetic and Evolutionary Computation Conference (GECCO)** – Spector gave a tutorial in 2011 ([spector-gecco2011.ppt](https://faculty.hampshire.edu/lspector/temp/spector-quantum-gecco2011.pdf#:~:text=Abstract%20Computer%20science%20will%20be,to%20grasp%20and%20even%20more)) and many GP results were first presented here; the **IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation (CEC)** – e.g. Rubinstein 2001 () and Spector et al. 1999 ([Publications | Lee Spector](https://lspector.github.io/publications.html#:~:text=Spector%2C%20L%2C%20H,99%2C%20AAAI%20Press)); the **NASA/ESA Conference on Adaptive Hardware and Systems / Evolvable Hardware**; journals like **Genetic Programming and Evolvable Machines**, **Quantum Information Processing**, **Artificial Intelligence for Engineering Design (AI-EDAM)** – which published Spector’s 2008 paper (); and more recently, **Quantum Science and Technology**, **Physical Review A/X**, and ML venues (NeurIPS, ICML workshops on quantum). There isn’t a single dedicated “quantum circuit discovery” conference, so researchers span multiple communities (quantum computing, evolutionary computing, and AI).

This cross-disciplinary nature means key contributions can come from very different angles – a physics lab aiming to discover new phenomena (Zeilinger’s group) or a computer science team automating algorithm design (Spector’s group) or an industry team optimizing performance (Zapata). All contribute to the theme of letting machines **creatively generate quantum circuits**.

## **Real-World Implementations and Industrial Adoption**

How much of this “evolve first, apply later” paradigm has made it into real-world use? At present, applications are mostly **research prototypes**, but there are a few noteworthy instances and signs of industrial interest:

* **Physical Experiments Designed by AI:** The MELVIN algorithm’s results were not just theory – the Vienna team *implemented some of the found configurations in the lab*. They successfully created a multi-photon high-dimensional entangled GHZ state using one of MELVIN’s discovered setups ([Physics \- Computer Chooses Quantum Experiments](https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/Physics.9.25#:~:text=What%E2%80%99s%20more%2C%20the%20setups%20look,dimensional%20entangled%20state%20%5B1)). This is a direct real-world implementation of an AI-designed quantum “circuit” (albeit an optical one). It demonstrates that such approaches can yield physically viable solutions. Following MELVIN, the same group worked on an AI called **Eva** to design quantum experiments with minimal human input, further showing the feasibility of self-driving discovery in experimental quantum setups. While these are physics experiments, they imply that *if an algorithm discovered a new quantum logic circuit*, one could attempt to run it on a quantum processor to validate it.  
* **Variational Algorithm Design in Industry:** Companies working on quantum algorithms for near-term devices have dabbled in automated circuit generation. **Zapata Computing**, as mentioned, integrated an evolutionary algorithm to optimize ansatz circuits for their chemistry and finance applications (). Their Orquestra platform allows hybrid workflows, and one can imagine an EA loop as part of those workflows to tailor circuits for a client’s problem. Similarly, **QC Ware** and **Quantum Inspire** have shown interest in ansatz discovery, though specific details are scarce. **Baidu** and **Alibaba** (in China) both have quantum teams; Baidu’s QAS work suggests they might use such techniques internally to improve quantum machine learning models.  
* **IBM and Rigetti** have mostly focused on manual or heuristic ansatz design, but IBM did implement an **AutoAnsatz** feature (in Qiskit’s experiment library) that tries different circuit layouts for a given problem. This is not a full GA, but it indicates a step toward automation. **Rigetti Computing** filed a patent on a method for generating ansatz circuits automatically (2019), hinting at internal development of these ideas.  
* **Noisy Hardware Calibration:** An indirect industrial use is in pulse-level control – some teams use evolutionary algorithms to find pulse sequences that implement a desired gate with higher fidelity on real hardware. For example, *Quantum Inspire (TU Delft)* used genetic algorithms to optimize microwave pulse shapes for superconducting qubits. This is akin to evolving “circuits” in the analog domain for better performance. It’s utility-driven, but it shows EAs in action on quantum hardware.  
* **Education and Open-Source:** Tools like GA4QCO are open-source and can be used by anyone to experiment with circuit evolution (). The Unitary Fund (an independent non-profit) created the GA-QAS search engine to help researchers find ansatz circuits easily, indicating community-driven adoption. Moreover, with the availability of quantum simulators via Python (Qiskit, Cirq, etc.), hobbyists and students have begun experimenting with GA for simple tasks (a few blog posts exist where people evolve a 2-qubit circuit to generate a Bell state, essentially reproducing Rubinstein’s experiment). This grass-roots experimentation is not industrial, but it’s “real-world” in the sense of more people trying the approach.

That said, **the paradigm of discovering a circuit and then looking for its application is not yet a standard industry workflow**. Companies tend to start from the problem (e.g. “optimize portfolio”) and then maybe use AI to optimize the circuit for that problem. The idea of *mining the space of quantum circuits for gems* and later figuring out if those gems do something useful is still primarily a research curiosity. We are not yet at the stage where, say, a quantum software company maintains a database of strange circuits waiting to be matched to problems. However, one could envision in the future a sort of “quantum algorithm repository” generated by AI, where engineers could sift through to see if any discovered circuit fits their needs (similar to how drug companies screen libraries of molecules for useful activity).

In summary, real-world implementations are currently **limited** but promising: we have tangible examples in experimental physics and early adoption in variational algorithm tuning. As quantum hardware scales, these methods might become more attractive to get the most out of devices (since brute-force design will be infeasible). For now, the impact is mainly in demonstrating that machine-generated circuits *can work in reality*, and in seeding the idea to quantum developers that AI can assist or even automate parts of circuit design.

## **Gaps and Opportunities**

Despite two decades of work and some impressive results, there remain significant **gaps and unexplored opportunities** in this field:

* **Truly Open-Ended Search:** As discussed, no one has fully embraced a search with *no specific end-goal* for quantum circuits. There is an opportunity to develop **novelty-guided or exploration-driven algorithms** that chart out the “landscape” of quantum circuit space. Such algorithms might use **novelty metrics** (distance from known circuits in some feature space) or **curiosity-driven rewards** (like maximizing unpredictability of outcomes) to continually find new circuit behaviors. This could lead to a repository of unusual circuits which could then be tested on various inputs to see if they perform any known logic or new function. The gap here is methodological (designing the right diversity metrics for quantum behavior) and practical (devising efficient ways to search the astronomically large space of circuits). **Quality-diversity algorithms** (e.g. MAP-Elites) could be one approach: maintain a grid of circuits categorized by some behavioral characteristics (like “degree of entanglement” vs “circuit depth”) and try to fill that grid with high-performing examples. So far, this idea remains largely theoretical for quantum circuits.  
* **Reverse Mapping and Automation of Understanding:** Suppose an algorithm does spit out a circuit that, by some metric, is interesting. The next challenge is **figuring out what it does** – essentially, reverse-engineering the “application” or function of that circuit. Currently, this step relies on human experts: e.g. Spector’s team, upon evolving a circuit, had to analyze it and realize “aha, this is solving the OR of two oracles problem.” In the future, we might create tools that automatically attempt to **analyze quantum circuits** (perhaps using techniques from formal verification or by comparing truth tables) to identify if the circuit is equivalent to any known algorithm or if it has a recognizable structure (like a Fourier transform or a teleportation protocol). Some early work in automated reasoning about quantum programs exists, but integrating that with a discovery engine is new. This is a clear gap – without it, an open-ended generator might produce genius circuits that go unrecognized. An opportunity here is to use AI for the analysis side as well, maybe training a classifier to label a given circuit as “likely a Fredkin gate” or “implements a parity function,” etc. In essence, building a pipeline: **generate \-\> detect patterns \-\> map to application**.  
* **Scalability to More Qubits:** Most evolutionary or ML circuit discovery efforts have been on *small qubit counts* (2–5 qubits typically, maybe up to 8–10 in some variational cases). The search space grows exponentially with qubit number and circuit depth, making naive exploration infeasible beyond a point. There’s a gap in methods that can scale these ideas to larger systems. Promising directions include: co-evolution (evolve smaller sub-circuits or modules that can be composed), using **transfer learning** (train an RL agent on 2 qubits, then try to generalize to 3 or 4), or guiding search with theoretical insights (for instance, knowing that certain gate sequences are symmetries or that some large circuits are just repeats of a smaller pattern). **Hierarchical approaches** might evolve high-level operations which themselves are circuits (like evolve “use QFT” vs “use Grover’s step” as building blocks). This could tame complexity by searching in a space of *operations* rather than individual gates once beyond a certain size. So far, little has been published on evolving circuits for, say, 16 qubits, but this will need to be addressed to keep the approach relevant as quantum hardware grows.  
* **Integration with Quantum Hardware Feedback:** Another opportunity is to incorporate *real hardware* in the loop. Instead of evaluating circuits purely via simulation, one could test them on an actual quantum processor (especially as cloud access to quantum devices is now common). The **fitness** could then include real metrics like observed fidelity or actual error rates. This would evolve circuits tailored to the specific noise profile of a device – perhaps discovering tricks to maximize entanglement given noisy qubits. There is a challenge in that hardware runs are slow and noisy, but some experiments (like evolutionary pulse shaping by Delft) hint that it’s possible. This area is largely unexplored for open-ended discovery; it could be quite powerful to find circuits that are not just theoretically interesting but also experimentally robust.  
* **Exploring New Quantum Regimes:** Open-ended circuit discovery might stumble upon circuits that create exotic states (like highly entangled or non-stabilizer “magic” states). These could have applications in things like quantum metrology or as subroutines in bigger algorithms (magic states are a resource for fault-tolerant computing, for example). A gap is that most search algorithms restrict to a standard gate set (Clifford+T, or parameterized rotations). By broadening the search space to include, say, more general two-qubit unitaries or even multi-qubit gates, an evolutionary approach might find more **exotic quantum operations** that we haven’t studied in depth. However, this comes at a cost of an even larger search space. Clever ways to navigate that (perhaps using symmetry or algebraic simplification during the search) would be needed.  
* **Interdisciplinary Collaboration:** Many gaps could be filled by bridging communities. For example, **evolutionary computation experts** might not be fully aware of the peculiar needs of quantum circuits (like preserving unitarity, handling non-deterministic measurement outcomes in fitness evaluation, etc.), while **quantum information scientists** might not know the latest techniques in open-ended evolutionary search (like novelty search, MAP-Elites). More collaboration could spark new approaches tailor-made for quantum discovery. Already, some crossover is seen (e.g. the Entropy 2023 paper by Ding & Spector that combines multi-objective EA with quantum tasks ([Publications | Lee Spector](https://lspector.github.io/publications.html#:~:text=Ding%2C%20L,%28full%20text))), but there is room for more, including involving **cognitive science or creativity research** to treat quantum algorithm discovery as a creative process.

## **How Novel is the “Discover First, Apply Later” Approach?**

Finally, to directly address the question: is the approach of discovering quantum circuits first and then finding their applications *novel, partially explored, or well-established*?

**Our assessment:** It is **partially explored**, but far from well-established as a standard approach. Here’s why:

* **Not Totally Novel:** We’ve seen that *elements* of this approach have appeared in prior research. Spector’s genetic programming work indeed had the flavor of discovering algorithms that weren’t initially known – essentially *inventions by the machine*, which were later understood and published as new quantum algorithms (). Krenn’s MELVIN found experimental setups that only after discovery were realized to produce a desired entangled state ([Physics \- Computer Chooses Quantum Experiments](https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/Physics.9.25#:~:text=Quantum%20theory%20verifies%20that%20Melvin%E2%80%99s,to%20quantum%20physics%2C%E2%80%9D%20says%20Krenn)). These are concrete cases where the circuit/experiment came first, the interpretation (application) second. So the concept itself is not entirely unheard of; it has proof-of-concept demonstrations. Researchers have at least implicitly considered that you might let the computer be creative and then you as a human figure out what it built.  
* **Not Systematically Studied:** However, these instances were relatively rare and often framed as solving a known problem (just in an unconventional way). The general philosophy of open-ended quantum circuit exploration has **not been a mainstream research program**. Most work, even in automated circuit design, still starts with a particular target (an algorithm to implement, a state to prepare, a dataset to classify). The idea of a “quantum algorithm generator” that just churns out novel circuits for us to later sift through is intriguing but hasn’t been fully developed. There is no established body of knowledge on how to best do that, what metrics to use, how to store and catalog the discovered circuits, etc. So in that sense, it’s quite novel and open – there’s a lot of room to carve out new research here.  
* **Partially Explored \= Some Pieces Are There:** The building blocks needed for such an approach do exist from partial explorations: methods to generate circuits randomly or through evolution, ways to measure circuit properties (entanglement, etc.), and examples where surprising circuits emerged. What’s missing is gluing these together into a coherent pipeline whose express purpose is *discovery for discovery’s sake*. One could say the approach is in a **nascent stage** – it’s been hinted at by prior successes, but not formalized. For instance, there is no standard “novel quantum circuit benchmark” or agreed set of “interestingness metrics” in the community. That signifies that we are not yet at a mature, well-established state for this approach.  
* **Community Reception:** The quantum computing community has been somewhat cautious – new algorithms are big news, but if one is found by a machine, researchers might be skeptical or demand clear proof of its utility. Thus, focusing on discovering circuits without a guarantee of usefulness might be seen as speculative. But as AI-assisted science gains traction (in drug discovery, mathematics, etc.), this attitude could shift. The approach may evolve from partially explored to well-accepted if a machine-discovered circuit ends up solving a major open problem or providing a clear quantum advantage somewhere. That hasn’t happened yet, so right now it’s still on the fringes of research.

In conclusion, the approach of “generate first, then find the purpose” for quantum circuits is **emerging but not yet mainstream**. Researchers like Spector and Krenn blazed the trail, showing that it can yield real, even award-winning results (). Recent advances in AI and a growing need for creative quantum solutions make this approach increasingly attractive to explore. The literature has many **related threads (evolutionary algorithms, RL, etc.) that can be woven together** to fully realize open-ended quantum circuit discovery. We see a clear opportunity for future work to treat quantum algorithms as something that can be *mined* by intelligent search processes. Doing so might uncover entirely new quantum capabilities and deepen our understanding of what quantum circuits can do, all while alleviating the burden on human intuition.
